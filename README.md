### **Heather Drury**
I have a four-year old son named Jack, who gets funnier and cuter every day. My husband's name is Dustin; we when I offered him a warm Fireball shot at a music festival in 2015. I have an (expensive) degree in art from Bellarmine, an obsession with renovating my house, and a love of cooking.

Here are my favorite things to cook:
- **Bun Bo Xa Ot** *a Vietnamese beef and noodle dish*
- **Avgolemono** *a Greek chicken and rice soup*
- **Tacos** *I have my own white people approach that my son loves and I could never dare to change*
